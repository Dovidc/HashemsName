        <p>In Judaism, the Divine is known by many sacred names, each carrying profound meaning and power. Among these is the mysterious 72-letter Name of G‑d—a name shrouded in secrecy and revered across generations. This ancient and formidable Name was wielded by the holiest of figures, including King David and his son, Solomon, to invoke forces beyond human comprehension. Here, we delve into the mysteries of this Name, exploring its timeless significance and the modern methods by which we might uncover its true form.</p>

        <p>In the story of the exodus from Egypt, three consecutive verses describe G‑d's power as manifest just before He split the Sea of Reeds, which the Jewish people passed through on dry land while the Egyptians were drowned. Exodus 14:19-21 each contain 72 letters, an obviously rare phenomenon. The letters of these three verses can be arranged as 72 triplets of letters. But we are taught in Kabbala that if we reverse the order of the letters in the middle set, the 72 triplets become 72 "names" of G‑d.</p>
